314	YDL140C	"RNA polymerase II largest subunit B220; part of central core; phosphorylation of C-terminal heptapeptide repeat domain regulates association with transcription and splicing factors; similar to bacterial beta-prime"	2.7.7.6	RNA polymerase II largest subunit B220	 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Largest and catalytic component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Forms the polymerase active center together with the second largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the Mediator complex assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. Elongation is influenced by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II largest subunit (RPB1), which serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing. Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. In elongating Pol II, the lid loop (RPB1) appears to act as a wedge to drive apart the DNA and RNA strands at the upstream end of the transcription bubble and guide the RNA strand toward the RNA exit groove located near the base of the largely unstructured CTD domain of RPB1. The rudder loop (RPB1) interacts with single-stranded DNA after separation from the RNA strand, likely preventing reassociation with the exiting RNA. The cleft is surrounded by jaws: an upper jaw formed by portions of RBP1, RPB2 and RPB9, and a lower jaw, formed by RPB5 and portions of RBP1. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template, mainly by RPB5 direct contacts to DNA.	2.7.7.6	DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1 (RNA polymerase II subunit 1) (RNA polymerase II subunit B1) (EC 2.7.7.6) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase III largest subunit) (RNA polymerase II subunit B220)	"RPO21, RPB1, RPB220, SUA8;

Component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB4 is part of a subcomplex with RPB7 that binds to a pocket formed by RPB1, RPB2 and RPB6 at the base of the clamp element. The RBP4-RPB7 subcomplex seems to lock the clamp via RPB7 in the closed conformation thus preventing double-stranded DNA to enter the active site cleft. The RPB4-RPB7 subcomplex binds single-stranded DNA and RNA. The RPB4-RPB7 subcomplex is necessary for promoter-directed transcription initiation but is not required for recruitment of Pol II to active preinitiation complexes and seems to be dispensable for transcription elongation and termination. The RPB4-RPB7 subcomplex recruits FCP1 to Pol II. Involved in DNA repair of damage in the transcribed strand. RPB4 is dispensable under optimal growth conditions, but becomes essential during heat or cold shock and under nutrient depletion. Suppresses the RBP9-mediated transcription-coupled repair (TCR) subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) but facilitates the RAD26-mediated TCR subpathway.

Can participate in redox reactions and is able to catalyze dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with other proteins, albeit with relatively low efficiency. May form transient disulfide bonds with nascent polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum and thereby promote efficient glycosylation. N-glycosylation occurs cotranslationally and the complex associates with the Sec61 complex at the channel-forming translocon complex that mediates protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). All subunits are required for a maximal oligosaccharyl transferase activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19549845}.	2.4.99.18	Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit OST6

796	YOR151C	"RNA polymerase II second largest subunit B150; part of central core; similar to bacterial beta subunit"	2.7.7.6	RNA polymerase II second largest subunit B150	 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Second largest component of RNA polymerases II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Proposed to contribute to the polymerase catalytic activity and forms the polymerase active center together with the largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the Mediator complex assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. The cleft is surrounded by jaws: an upper jaw formed by portions of RBP1, RPB2 and RPB9, and a lower jaw. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. The fork loop 1 (RPB2) interacts with the RNA-DNA hybrid, possibly stabilizing it.	2.7.7.6	DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB2 (RNA polymerase II subunit 2) (EC 2.7.7.6) (B150) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II 140 kDa polypeptide)	"RPB2, RPB150, RPO22, SIT2, SOH2; DNA-directed RNA polymerase II core subunit RPB2"	2.7.7.6	RNA Polymerase B	"Recruitment of RNA Polymerase II Holoenzyme by TFIIF to the pol II promoter:TFIID:TFIIA:TFIIB complex;Formation of the closed pre-initiation complex;Addition of nucleotides between position +11 and +30;Hypophosphorylation of RNA Pol II CTD by FCP1P protein;DSIF complex binds to RNA Pol II (hypophosphorylated);Abortive termination of early transcription elongation by DSIF:NELF;Extrusion of 5'-end of 30 nt long transcript through the pore in Pol II complex;RNA Pol II initiates transcription from damaged DNA template;Active RNA Pol II complex transcribes lesion-containing DNA template;ERCC6 binds stalled RNA Pol II;ERCC8:DDB1:CUL4:RBX1 ubiquitinates ERCC6 and RNA Pol II;UVSSA:USP7 deubiquitinates ERCC6;RNA Pol II backtracking in TC-NER;Binding of ERCC1:ERCC4 (ERCC1:XPF) to pre-incision complex in TC-NER;5' incision of damaged DNA strand by ERCC1:ERCC4 in TC-NER;Repair DNA synthesis of ~27-30 bases long patch by POLD, POLE or POLK in TC-NER;DNA polymerases delta, epsilon or kappa bind the TC-NER site;3' incision by ERCC5 (XPG) in TC-NER;Ligation of newly synthesized repair patch to incised DNA in TC-NER;CDK12 phosphorylates RNA Pol II CTD at DNA repair genes;CCNK:CDK12 binds RNA Pol II at DNA repair genes;Formation of AT-AC C complex;ATAC spliceosome mediated Lariat formation,5' splice site cleavage;Addition of the third nucleotide on the nascent transcript;NTP Binds Active Site of RNA Polymerase II;Fall Back to Closed Pre-initiation Complex;Newly Formed Phosphodiester Bond Stabilized and PPi Released;Nucleophillic Attack by 3'-hydroxyl Oxygen of nascent transcript on the Alpha Phosphate of NTP;Addition of the fourth nucleotide on the Nascent Transcript: Second Transition;RNA Polymerase II Promoter Opening: First Transition;Addition of nucleotides 10 and 11 on the growing transcript: Third Transition;Activation of GT;Phosphorylation (Ser5) of RNA pol II CTD;SPT5 subunit of Pol II binds the RNA triphosphatase (RTP);Capping complex formation;Hydrolysis of the 5'-end of the nascent transcript by the capping enzyme;Formation of the CE:GMP intermediate complex;Transfer of GMP from the capping enzyme GT site to 5'-end of mRNA;Dissociation of  transcript with 5'-GMP from GT;Recognition and binding of the mRNA cap by the cap-binding complex"	"a ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate + RNAn => diphosphate + RNAn+1;diphosphate + RNAn+1 => a ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate + RNAn"	"Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;UTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;ATP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;GTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;CTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;n Nucleoside triphosphate <=> 5'-Triphospho-[mRNA](n) + (n-1) Diphosphate;nucleoside triphosphate + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;GTP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;CTP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;ATP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1"	"a ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate + RNAn => diphosphate + RNAn+1;diphosphate + RNAn+1 => a ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate + RNAn"	"Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;UTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;ATP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;GTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;CTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;n Nucleoside triphosphate <=> 5'-Triphospho-[mRNA](n) + (n-1) Diphosphate;nucleoside triphosphate + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;GTP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;CTP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;ATP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1"	a nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = RNA(n+1) + diphosphate	"ATP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;GTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;CTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;UTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA"		5 out of 5	Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate + RNA(n+1).	0.046 AMP [cytoplasm] + 0.0447 CMP [cytoplasm] + 0.046 GMP [cytoplasm] + 0.0599 UMP [cytoplasm] => RNA [cytoplasm] 	YES	RNA polymerase	pathway from kegg	H1118			"Purine metabolism;Pyrimidine metabolism;Metabolic pathways;RNA polymerase"		"Formation of the Early Elongation Complex;RNA Polymerase II Pre-transcription Events;Formation of TC-NER Pre-Incision Complex;Dual incision in TC-NER;Gap-filling DNA repair synthesis and ligation in TC-NER;TP53 Regulates Transcription of DNA Repair Genes;mRNA Capping;mRNA Splicing - Minor Pathway;RNA Polymerase II Promoter Escape;RNA Polymerase II Transcription Pre-Initiation And Promoter Opening;RNA Polymerase II Transcription Initiation;RNA Polymerase II Transcription Initiation And Promoter Clearance;RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation and interaction with CE"	"Purine metabolism;path:map00230;Pyrimidine metabolism;path:map00240;Metabolic pathways;path:map01100"	nucleus	"nucleus;mitochondrion;cytoplasm"	nucleus

First, a [2Fe-2S] cluster is transiently assembled on the scaffold proteins ISU1 and ISU2. In a second step, the cluster is released from ISU1/ISU2, transferred to glutaredoxin GRX5, followed by the formation of mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] proteins, the synthesis of [4Fe-4S] clusters and their target-specific insertion into the recipient apoproteins. Cluster assembly on ISU1/ISU2 depends on the function of the cysteine desulfurase complex NFS1-ISD11, which serves as the sulfur donor for cluster synthesis, the iron-binding protein frataxin (YFH1) as the putative iron donor, and the electron transfer chain comprised of ferredoxin reductase ARH1 and ferredoxin YAH1, which receive their electrons from NADH. Fe-S cluster release from ISU1/ISU2 is achieved by interaction with the Hsp70 chaperone SSQ1, assisted by the DnaJ-like co-chaperone JAC1 and the nucleotide exchange factor MGE1. ISU1 is the major isoform in yeast, while ISU2 is not detectable in cells grown to stationary phase (By similarity). ISU2 is the minor isoform in yeast and is not detectable in cells grown to stationary phase (PubMed:10588895). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q03020, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10588895}.

First, a [2Fe-2S] cluster is transiently assembled on the scaffold proteins ISU1 and ISU2. In a second step, the cluster is released from ISU1/ISU2, transferred to glutaredoxin GRX5, followed by the formation of mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] proteins, the synthesis of [4Fe-4S] clusters and their target-specific insertion into the recipient apoproteins. Cluster assembly on ISU1/ISU2 depends on the function of the cysteine desulfurase complex NFS1-ISD11, which serves as the sulfur donor for cluster synthesis, the iron-binding protein frataxin (YFH1) as the putative iron donor, and the electron transfer chain comprised of ferredoxin reductase ARH1 and ferredoxin YAH1, which receive their electrons from NADH. Fe-S cluster release from ISU1/ISU2 is achieved by interaction with the Hsp70 chaperone SSQ1, assisted by the DnaJ-like co-chaperone JAC1 and the nucleotide exchange factor MGE1. ISU1 is the major isoform in yeast, while ISU2 is not detectable in cells grown to stationary phase (PubMed:10588895, PubMed:12970193, PubMed:14741370, PubMed:15123690, PubMed:16341089, PubMed:16431909, PubMed:23615440, PubMed:25358379). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10588895, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12970193, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14741370, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15123690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16341089, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16431909, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23615440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25358379}.

A bridging helix emanates from RPA190 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol I by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18160037, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24153182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24153184}.	2.7.7.6	DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit RPA135 (EC 2.7.7.6) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase I 135 kDa polypeptide) (A135) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase I polypeptide 2) (RNA polymerase I subunit 2)	"RPA135, RPA2, RRN2, SRP3; DNA-directed RNA polymerase I core subunit RPA135"	2.7.7.6	RNA Polymerase A	Binding of RRN3 to RNA Polymerase I	"a ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate + RNAn => diphosphate + RNAn+1;diphosphate + RNAn+1 => a ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate + RNAn"	"Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;UTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;ATP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;GTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;CTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;n Nucleoside triphosphate <=> 5'-Triphospho-[mRNA](n) + (n-1) Diphosphate;nucleoside triphosphate + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;GTP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;CTP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;ATP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1"	"a ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate + RNAn => diphosphate + RNAn+1;diphosphate + RNAn+1 => a ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate + RNAn"	"Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;UTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;ATP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;GTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;CTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;n Nucleoside triphosphate <=> 5'-Triphospho-[mRNA](n) + (n-1) Diphosphate;nucleoside triphosphate + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;GTP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;CTP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1;ATP + RNAn = diphosphate + RNAn+1"	a nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = RNA(n+1) + diphosphate	"ATP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;GTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;CTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA;UTP + RNA <=> Diphosphate + RNA"		5 out of 5	Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate + RNA(n+1). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18160037, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24153182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24153184}.	0.046 AMP [cytoplasm] + 0.0447 CMP [cytoplasm] + 0.046 GMP [cytoplasm] + 0.0599 UMP [cytoplasm] => RNA [cytoplasm] 	YES	RNA polymerase	pathway from kegg	H1118			"Purine metabolism;Pyrimidine metabolism;Metabolic pathways;RNA polymerase"		RNA Polymerase I Transcription Initiation	"Purine metabolism;path:map00230;Pyrimidine metabolism;path:map00240;Metabolic pathways;path:map01100"	nucleus	nucleus	nucleus
