* Fixes:
  * Fixes #96: regardless if the model is saved with a windows or a MAC machine, the `.xml` file is now stored with the same scientific format.
  * Fixes #108: No CHEBI or KEGG ids are now shared by different metabolites. Also, updated the metabolites that were skipped in the previous manual curation (PR #74).
  * Remade function for defining confidence scores, which fixed 38 scores in `rxnConfidenceScores` (most of them from pseudoreactions).
  * `loadYeastModel` and `saveYeastModel` were improved to allow their use also when outside of the actual folder.

### yeast 8.1.0:
* New features:
  * SLIME reactions added to the model using [SLIMEr](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/SLIMEr), to properly account for constraints on lipid metabolism (fixes #21):
    * SLIME rxns replace old ISA rxns for lumping lipids. They create 2 types of lipid pseudometabolites: backbones and acyl chains.
    * There are now 3 lipid pseudoreactions: 1 constrains backbones, 1 constrains acyl chains, 1 merges both.
* Fixes:
  * All metabolite formulas made compliant with SBML (fixes #19). Model is now a valid SBML object.
  * Biomass composition was rescaled to experimental data from [Lahtvee et al. 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471217300881), including protein and RNA content, trehalose and glycogen concentrations, lipid profile and FAME data. Biomass was fitted to add up to 1 g/gDW by rescaling total carbohydrate content (unmeasured).
* Refactoring:
  * Organized all files in `ComplementaryData`
